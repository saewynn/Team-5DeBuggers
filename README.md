Things we need to fix after we have completed the AVC (when we do get another chance):
The battery 
The coding
The wiring

Week 1 Review (22nd Apil 2016)
- [x] Everyone this really well this week given the fact our first lab was on a Friday - so we were not able to do much. Our AVC plans were due that Friday at midnight so our main
focus was completing our AVC plans.
- [x] Everyone other than Sahil and Harry completed their assigned tasks - Sahil started on writing some some codes but did not complete and Harry had not time left to try and connect
the computer to the robot.
- [x] We have set goals for the next week(Week 2 checklist)
- [x] Sahil would try to finish writing his code
- [x] Since the following week was a mid-break, it was very difficult for any of the team members get anything/much done, as the ENGR 101 labs were not available to use. Especically, for
Harry and Zihao as they were both responsible for the hardware part of this AVC challenge. And even if Sahil and Ned had written some codes, they would be unable to go use the labs
to test if the code works.
- [x] Everyone signed the AVC plan. 








Week 2 Checklist:
- [x]   Ei Htoo(E2): Arrange team meetings/ meet-ups via facebook
- [x]   E2: Update GitHub with progress; write weekly updates/ checklists
- [ ]   ~~Ned: Create code for the camera to take a picture and measure the whiteness of the pixels, allowing the robot to move toward the white line~~(he wrote some basic codes
but he could not test them to see if his codes actually worked as the labs were closed during the mid-break)
- [x]   Sahil: Do research on SSH
- [x]   Sahil: Start writing the code to make the gate open up (he started to write basic codes after researching SSH)
- [ ]   ~~Ned: Getting the robot to move~~
- [ ]   ~~Ned: Write code to set-up the hardware and get the robot moving~~
- [ ]   ~~Harry: Assembling the robot~~ (he was unable to do this as it was mid-break and the computer labs were unavailable to for use)
- [ ]   ~~Harry: Finalised designs of the model (robot) - providing some feedback, suggestions and opinions on the final robot design~~
- [ ]   ~~Zihao: Use the 3D printer to print the path of the final design for the robot~~ (he was unable to do this because it was mid-break)


Incomplete Tasks from Week 1:
- [ ]  ~~Sahil: Writing codes to get the robot to communicate with the computer~~ (there was no time left)
- [ ]  ~~Zihao: Develop a prototype chassis~~(he still could not get this done as it was mid-break)
- [ ]  ~~Harry: Physically connecting the computer to the robot~~(it was mid-break, so the labs were closed)


Week 2 Review:
- [x] Since the following week was a mid-break, it was very difficult for any of the team members to get anything/much done, as the ENGR 101 labs were not available to use. 
Especically, for Harry and Zihao as they are both working on the hardware part of this AVC challenge. And even if Sahil and Ned had written some codes, they would be unable to go and
test if the code works in the labs.








Week 3 Checklist: 
- [x]   E2: Check each member progress
- [ ]   ~~E2: Debug codes~~ (there was no time left)
- [x]   E2: Writing weekly updates/ checklists - Update GitHub 
- [x]   Sahil: Figure out SSH/ do SSH and upload the code.
- [ ]   ~~Ned: Develop robot movement~~(he was sick so Sahil stepped in and wrote a code to get the robot moving)
- [x]   Zihao: Make modifications to the robot design if any error were to occur during the trial runs/ experiements/ when testing if the code works
- [ ]   ~~Zihao: Modify the design~~ (he was unable to use the 3D printer as others were also using it
- [x]   Harry: Help Zihao modify the design if any errors were to pop up when running the robot
- [x]   Harry: Observe the robot when it is moving along the maze 


Incomplete Tasks from Week 1:
- [x]  Sahil: Writing codes to get the robot to communicate with the computer
- [x]  Zihao: Develop a prototype chassis
- [x]  Harry: Physically connecting the computer to the robot (Sahil helped with this)
- [x]  Sahil: Writing codes to get the robot to communicate with the computer (SSH)


Incomplete Tasks from Week 2
- [ ]   ~~Ned: Create code for the camera to take a picture and measure the whiteness of the pixels, allowing the robot to move toward the white line~~(he wrote some basic codes
but he could not test them to see if his codes actually worked as the labs were closed during the mid-break)

Week 3 Review:
Everyone except Ned came to the team meeting this week - where we were supposed to work on some codes and develop a prototype chassis (Ned sent his apologies due to illness).
We were able to finally get the robot moving but not the way we want it to - which is to follow the white line. Sahil's networking code to open the gate worked successfully worked.
On our AVC plan, we wrote we would complete quadrant 1, but because we did not have any other code except the networking code done, we could not test our robot.









Week 4 Review:
Finally, all the team members were at the lab and we were all able to test the code Ned had written for the robot to follow the white line and to get through quadrant 1. Sahil had also managed to finally get the networking code to work; the code for opening the gate for a short period of 4 seconds. Since our progress reports were due in on Monday, Zihao, Harry and I were working on our reports. Both Sahil and Ned explained how their codes worked (how it is supposed to work) and Zihao and Harry explained the components they used to assemble the robot. Because Zihao was not satisfied with the overall design of the robot Sahil, Harry, me and Zihao all worked togehter to take the robot apart and changed the black wheels and to make it into a tank (rubber band. After that, both Sahil and Ned began testing the code. There was however a problem with the code as the robot kept on spinning in circles and would not do what we wanted it too. Then it was suggested to us by our lab demonstrator, the problem could be due to the speed the motors are set to. Because we had tank wheels, we would require a much faster speed to get it to move as there was a greater friction. Sahil and Ned tried and did various things to see get the code working; such as increasing the speeds, etc. We later thought that maybe it was a hardware problem - there might have been an issue with the camera. But we later realised that the problem is the code. We were all pretty worn our after 4 hours in the lab so we gave it rest.
Our initial AVC plan included us completing Quadrant 1 and 2 by Week 4 but we could not stay on track with our plan as the written codes would not work the we had wanted it to.
This week was also a very hectic week as we all had a COMP 102 test to revise for so our main focus was on the test.







Week 5 Checklist
On Monday, Ned and Sahil met up at the lab to work on the code. And they said that they finallly fixed the code and it now works. But the problem was because we had tank wheels (which are held together by a rubber wheel/ band), when the robot turned the rubber bands would scrap onto the surface and they would come off. So Sahil suggested that the wheels should be 
changed back to the original wheels had initially planned to use - which were the big black wheels. Zihao liked the design of the robot being a tank, so what he did was use the 3D printer to create a new board to fit make the wheels more stable - he prefered the tank design compared to the black wheels.

Harry brought toy car and wanted to modify the design of the wheels. But the due date is 2 weeks, so all the members decided anything that was not provide to the team will not be used for the design.

The problem was the code had initially worked on the robot with the tank wheels. Zihao's made a few errors when designing the black board with the 3D printer. (The base was too small). Zihao finally decided to switch the tank wheels back to the black big wheels. 































    
1st code:
Self note:
Motor is left, right
Direction is forward and back
Speed is from 0-255

My code is:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

extern "C" int InitHardware();

extern "C" int Sleep(int sec, int usec);
extern "C" int SetMotor(int motor, int dir, int speed);

int main(){

InitHardware();

SetMotor (1,1,100);
SetMotor (2,1,255);
Sleep(0,500000);

SetMotor(1,1,255);
SetMotor(2,1,100);
Sleep(0,500000);

return 0;}
